GluKoBall Game Prototype
====

TODO:
1. Gravity physics, change gravity depending on the spin.
2. Proper point mark on trajectory. It's npt clear where the ball lands.
3. Shooting feels clunky and artificial.

4. Create stamina bar. Stamina deplets with each hold button. When stamina depleted ball power is not increasing. Stamina recovers with time.
So it's like throttle to holding buttons.
5. left button should behave like right button. In a sense - it only activates when button released and power equal to holding amount (or standard if pressed once).
6. Gravity or drag ? We should make trajectory unpredictable, either with small random amount or not showing full trajectory. We can show trajectory image on a gun for example, but not showing where ball will drop. Probably would need to make proto with each typ.e

7. Move camera a little duting aiming but leave UI in place. Aim Constraint component?
8.
